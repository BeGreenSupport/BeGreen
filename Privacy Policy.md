Our Privacy Policy:

Please take a few minutes to read the following policy so that you understand what type of data we store and how we treat it. As we continue to expand and improve our services, our policy may change. So please check it periodically. 

This privacy policy applies to the BeGreen application and your use of the mobile application constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at ‘BeGreen.ContactUs@gmail.com’.



What Data is stored

The BeGreen application does not store your data anywhere besides your local device. The data stored only includes the weight of materials you have recycled with the help of the BeGreen app. When using the service, we are only storing data based on an estimation of how much you have recycled. The reason the data is stored on your local device is to keep track of your progress and use this data to determine a user’s overall impact on the planet when recycling. There is no personal data involved at all since we don’t require it and when using the application, you are not asked to store or share any data.


HOW WE USE DATA

The data we store serves only for being able to track your progress when recycling and to calculate user’s overall affect on the planet.


WHO HAS ACCES TO DATA

The data is only stored on the user’s local device and as a result they are the only person that can view the information. The data is displayed on the ‘My Impact’ page of the application only.
